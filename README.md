# MNIST_dataset
Hello everyone I am Samridhi Saxena a CSE undergrad student currently exploring data science . 
This project trains neural network on mnist dataset using tensorflow and its api keras 

# Introduction
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a widely used benchmark in machine learning. It consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). This project demonstrates a basic feedforward neural network's ability to accurately classify these digits.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded and loaded using tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(). It comprises:

60,000 training images and labels.

10,000 test images and labels.
Each image is a 28x28 grayscale pixel array, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. The labels are integers from 0 to 9.

# Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è
Core Framework: Deep Learning / Machine Learning
Primary Language: Python

# Libraries Used
## TensorFlow:

Purpose: The overarching open-source machine learning framework. Keras is integrated into TensorFlow as tf.keras.


## Keras (as tf.keras):

Purpose: A high-level API for building and training deep learning models, known for its user-friendliness and rapid prototyping capabilities. It runs on top of TensorFlow.


## NumPy:

Purpose: The fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, especially for handling arrays and matrices.


 ## Matplotlib:

Purpose: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
